	 <dd>I had interhsip in a company called ComTrade, located in Sarajevo.<br/>The task was to make a Travel tracker App using Java Spring Boot. Database used was PostgreSQL.<br/>
	 The project was called Travel Activity Tracker, and the user could book a hotel from a variety of options. 
	 After the hotel was booked, the user would be given a map in which the user could see the route He is supposed to take.<br/> If the hotel was closer than 300km the user would be given a road map.
	 If the hotel was  more than 300km away, the user would be shown a world map with a plane animation flying from the closest airport to the destination.</br>
	 I was responsible for the Front end mostly, a little of back end, and for the map interface.<br/>
	 Some images of how the project looked like, the entire project can be seen on my github profile!<br/>
